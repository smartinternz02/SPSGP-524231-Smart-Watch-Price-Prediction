Smart Watch Price Prediction
This repository holds project files of project: Smart Watch Price Prediction using suitable Machine Learning algorithm

The SmartWatch Price Detection repository is a machine learning project aimed at automatically detecting and predicting the prices of smartwatches.

So basically this repository has 5 folders excluding readme.md file

At first the "CSV file" folder has the necessary dataset which is "smart watch prices.csv" dataset and this same dataset is also at Jupyter notebook files.

Then I have "Jupyter notebook files" here I have the "Smart-watch-price-prediction.ipynb" where I have worked our Machine Learning model ,I have our dataset and "model1.pkl" and "model2.pkl" files.

Then I have "Flask and html folders" here we have "f.py" where I run our flask application with "model1.pkl" and "model2.pkl" files for predicting the values by dumping and we have "template" folder where we have two files "index.html"(used to get user values) and "pass.html" to output the predicted value.

Next I have "Project Report Document" folder where we have detailed explanation of our project as word file and in the word file I have mentioned introduction, approaches and solution, problem description, flowchart, block diagram, code explanation, hardware and software requirements, Literature survey, results, advantages and disadvantages, conclusions, future scope etc,.

Then I have "SmartInternz Assignment-1,2,3" folder where I have three Assignments given by the SmartInternz during the training session with both "pdf" files and "ipynb" files.

Last Here I have mention the project explanation video link as drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11shU3i6AqccZDstosNd4HLgVBcAmMS81/view?usp=sharing also i have made a seperate two folders for video where "video file" has drive link which I mentioned and the "demo video for 2-3 mintues" has short rehearse and brief explanation video for 2-3 minutes. So in short for full length video use the drive link and for the demo video it's in the folder itself.
